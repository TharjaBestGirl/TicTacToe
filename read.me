Jack and Joseph's Tic-Tac-Toe

Jack(Person 1)
Joseph(Person 2)

Our program is simple tic-tac-toe using a vector to store the game's data. You can run the code by compiling it. You enter in the square that you want to place the marker in and the current turn's player will place their marker in that square, starting with X and alternating players.
